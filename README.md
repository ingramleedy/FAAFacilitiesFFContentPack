# FAA Districts and Facilities Content Pack for ForeFlight

This repository provides a **ForeFlight content pack** containing custom map overlays for FAA districts, facilities, ARTCC (Air Route Traffic Control Center) sectors, and TRACONs (Terminal Radar Approach Controls). These overlays assist pilots and aviation enthusiasts in visualizing airspace boundaries, control sectors, and key facilities for improved situational awareness and flight planning.

The content pack displays ARTCC sectors and TRACON boundaries as a custom map layer in ForeFlight, integrating seamlessly with airspace, terrain, sectional charts, and other layers for enhanced route planning and navigation.

## Content Overview

This content pack includes overlays for FAA districts, major facilities, ARTCC sectors across the United States, and associated TRACON areas. It draws from official FAA data sources to provide accurate, up-to-date boundaries and labels.

The pack focuses on high-level airspace structures, supplementing ForeFlight's native FAA data with detailed sector visualizations for better understanding of enroute and terminal airspace.

### Enhanced Usage with ForeFlight Airspace Tools

For optimal use in flight planning, combine this content pack with ForeFlight's **Airspace** and **Profile View** features. Airspace layers highlight class boundaries, while Profile View provides a vertical cross-section of sectors along your route.

- **Activation:** Enable the custom layer in Map Settings > Layers > User Content. Adjust zoom levels to view sector details.  
- **In-Flight Mode:** Use with ADS-B or GPS for real-time position relative to sectors.  
- **Subscription Note:** Custom content packs work with any ForeFlight subscription, but advanced features like Profile View require Pro Plus or higher.

This integration helps in identifying handoff points, frequency changes, and airspace transitions during complex flights.

## Inspiration and Credits

This content pack is inspired by and draws from official FAA resources:

- **Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)** – Primary source for airspace data, ARTCC boundaries, and TRACON definitions.  
- **FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)** – Guidance on airspace structure and usage.  
- **FAA Air Traffic Control Facilities Directory** – Details on centers and approach controls.  
- **National Airspace System (NAS) Resources** – Including digital charts and sector maps available via FAA websites.

## Included Content

The pack includes overlays for the following key elements, with boundaries, labels, and identifiers derived from FAA sources:

- **ARTCC Sectors:** Boundaries and identifiers for all 22 ARTCCs (e.g., ZDV - Denver, ZLA - Los Angeles), including high/low altitude sectors where applicable.  
- **TRACONs:** Terminal areas for major airports and regions (e.g., SoCal TRACON, Potomac TRACON), with approach/departure boundaries.  
- **FAA Districts and Facilities:** Overlays for Flight Standards District Offices (FSDOs), regional offices, and other key facilities.

*Note: Always verify with current FAA publications and NOTAMs for operational use. This pack is for planning and educational purposes.*
